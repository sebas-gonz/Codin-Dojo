            <p class="parrafo_contenido">JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and
                allowing lightweight language maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host
                environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over
                them.
            </p>
            <ul id="lista_contenido">
                <li><span class="index">Declaration JavaScript</span> variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee,
                    a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. <span class="important">var x;</span>
                </li>
                <li><span class="index">Assignment</span> Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our
                    variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable, <span class="important">var x = 10;</span>
                </li>
                <li><span class="index">Data</span> Types Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types
                    that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - <span></span>true or <span></span>false; null - <span></span>null aka nothing; Number - <span class="important">42</span> or <span class="important">3.14159;</span>
                    String - <span class="important">"Coding Dojo Rocks!"</span> Array - <span class="important">[1,'Coding', 2, 'Dojo'];</span> and Object - <span class="important">{first_name: ane', last_name: 'Doe'}</span>
                </li>
                <li><span class="index">Conditionals</span> When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on
                    values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following
                    conditional statements: <span class="important">if</span> a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; <span class="important">else if</span> to specify a new condition to test, if the first
                    condition is false; <span></span>else we execute this block of code;
                </li>
                <li><span class="index">Loops</span> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat
                    an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. Thats a loop!                                        
                </li>
                <li><span class="index">Function</span> Functions are an encaspulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Think ofit as a list of
                    instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we
                    screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more
                    tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over again.
